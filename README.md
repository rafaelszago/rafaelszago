### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software engineer and open-source enthusiast with +12 years of relevant experience in building and maintaining scalable and distributed web applications. Worked as a developer, consultant. Also an experienced leader with a strong background in all phases of a software development process and product management.

I believe in asynchronous work, remote work, lean, strong cultures. I wrote my first scripts for fun on the IRC network when I was 12 years old. Ever since, I've fallen in love with this digital world. I consider myself to be a self-learner who's passionate about the technology I work with. Iâ€™ve explored different areas such as affiliated marketing, digital courses and the financial market. Therefore I'm always looking to further develop my skills through application.

In the last three years, I've worked with influencer marketing. And in the last year at one of the largest influencer marketing agencies in Brazil, performing daily activities such as collecting data, understanding and generating insights for brands and influencers, creating workflows and applying them to the active product.
